    <h1>Understanding Emotions</h1>

    <div class="emotion">
        <h2>Anger</h2>
        <p>Anger is a natural and common human emotion. It can range from mild irritation to intense rage. Anger is often triggered by frustration, injustice, or feeling threatened. When expressed constructively, anger can lead to positive changes and problem-solving. However, uncontrolled anger can be harmful to oneself and others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="emotion">
        <h2>Disgust</h2>
        <p>Disgust is a strong emotional reaction to something unpleasant or offensive. It can be triggered by foul odors, tastes, sights, or ideas that go against one's values or standards. Disgust helps protect us from potential harm by motivating avoidance behaviors. It is also closely linked to moral judgments and social interactions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="emotion">
        <h2>Fear</h2>
        <p>Fear is a basic survival mechanism that alerts us to potential threats and dangers. It can be triggered by real or perceived risks, such as physical harm, rejection, or uncertainty about the future. Fear activates the body's fight-or-flight response, preparing us to either confront the threat or escape from it. While fear is essential for survival, excessive or irrational fear can be debilitating.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="emotion">
        <h2>Happiness</h2>
        <p>Happiness is a positive emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, contentment, and satisfaction. It can be triggered by various factors, including success, relationships, experiences, and personal fulfillment. Happiness has numerous physical and psychological benefits, such as improved health, resilience, and creativity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="emotion">
        <h2>Neutral</h2>
        <p>The neutral emotion represents a state of calmness, tranquility, and lack of strong emotional arousal. It is neither positive nor negative and often occurs when there are no significant stimuli or events to elicit an emotional response. Neutral states can vary in intensity and duration, ranging from momentary pauses to prolonged periods of relaxation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="emotion">
        <h2>Sadness</h2>
        <p>Sadness is a normal emotional response to loss, disappointment, or distressing events. It is characterized by feelings of unhappiness, sorrow, and low mood. Sadness can be triggered by various life circumstances, such as bereavement, failure, or loneliness. While sadness is a natural part of the human experience, persistent or overwhelming sadness may indicate depression.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="emotion">
        <h2>Surprise</h2>
        <p>Surprise is a sudden and unexpected emotional reaction to an unforeseen event or stimulus. It is characterized by a brief moment of astonishment, confusion, or disbelief. Surprise can be positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the context and individual interpretation. It plays a crucial role in adaptation and learning by prompting us to pay attention to new or unusual experiences.</p>
